# Holiday project for School of Code

In this project I practiced basic CRUD operations using PostgreSQL as a database.

It's based on a tutorial, some code in it is a bit too complex for me yet, but it was useful to go through the motions once again.

I accidentally pushed a file with a password so had to learn how to delete it in all my past commits.

[This article](https://blog.gitguardian.com/leaking-secrets-on-github-what-to-do/) was very helpful along with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msUDPYsbABY).

I had to install `Java` for that and download [bfg](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/), all as depicted in [this article](https://blog.gitguardian.com/leaking-secrets-on-github-what-to-do/). Interestingly, I couldnâ€™t use VSCode terminal for it, I had to use Windows' native `cmd`.
